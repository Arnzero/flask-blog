Buddy Report #1

The team I was integrated in consisted of myself and
 David Uribe. David gets 5 stars in my book for various reasons.
  He displayed persistance and geniunely cares to problem solve. 
  David is more of a beginner and I'm more experienced by a year 
  or so which makes me feel like I should be carrying both of us. 
  We both got stuck and discussed many logical options and took 
  the time to explain to each other possible approaches to this 
  assignment. I gave him advice on how to approach his "all route"
   and sql management. He gave me advice on how to the login should 
   work by helping me with boiler-plate code.
